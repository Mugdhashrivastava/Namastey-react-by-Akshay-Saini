#1.Headers:

    Use # to create headings. The number of # characters indicates the heading level

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3


#2.Text Styling:

I-talic: Enclose text in * or _ to make it italic, like *italic* or _italic_
    
-Bold: Use ** or __ for bold text, such as **bold** or __bold__.
    
-Bold and Italic: Combine * and ** or _ and __ to create both, like ***bold and italic*** or ___bold and italic___.


#3.Lists:

Unordered List: Start each item with *, -, or + followed by a space.

Ordered List: Use numbers followed by a period and a space, like 1., 2., and so on.

example:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

#4.Links:

To create a link, enclose the link text in square brackets [], followed by the URL in parentheses (). For example: [Google](https://www.google.com).

#5.Images:
Similar to links, but with an exclamation mark ! in front. Example: ![Alt Text](image_url)

#6.Quotes:
Use > at the beginning of a line to create blockquotes.
example:
> This is a blockquote.


#7.Code:
Inline code can be surrounded with backticks (`), like `code`.
For code blocks, use triple backticks (```) or indent the text by four spaces.


#8.Horizontal Rules:
To create a horizontal rule, use ---, ***, or ___ on a separate line.


#9.Tables 

Create tables with pipes | and hyphens - for the header row. Example
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |

#10.Escape Characters 
If you want to use a character that has a special meaning in Markdown (e.g., *, #, or [), you can escape it with a backslash.
