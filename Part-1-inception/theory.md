Extension: better comments
Plugin: react redux
Git : git easy

LIBRARY: minimum effort to put it inside the code,just some component can be of that library 
ex: carousel can be made using react library meanwhile the whole webiste is in other framework
FRAMEWORK: whole app , everything is made in that framework ,whole website or webapp

React: library because we can inject it easily in the code 


CDN : content delivery network, used to inject react into a js file 


What is Emmet???

crossorigin:
Cross-origin (or CORS{Cross-Origin Resource Sharing})
refers to a security feature that web browsers have. It's designed to protect your computer and data from potentially harmful code from different websites.
So, CORS in React is all about making sure your app can safely talk to other servers, like fetching data from an API, without compromising security. You need to configure the server (the other website) to allow your React app to communicate with it by setting the appropriate headers


React can exist without redux,jsx or typescript too
