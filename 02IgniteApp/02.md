 -   setup git hub 
 -  keep pushing code
 -  minify,compress,simplify code before going to production

 ### npm 
    manages packages
    doest stand for node package manager 
    [official npm website](https://www.npmjs.com): you can see here how npm is everything but doesnt stand for node package manager
    it is a node package manager but doesnt stand for so 


### app creation
Terminal commands
- npm init
- answer the questions : fill up git repo link, keywords, description etc and enter
- you will get package.json file


## package.json 
packages also known as dependencies 
npm is node package manager

where npm is working??
inside package.json ,gives version,etc other details


what is package.json???
configuration for npm

packages are dependecies



## Bundler 
packages the app properly so that it can go to production code. As bundler minifies ,compress, simplify etc complex codes
ex:parcel


## Parcel
    npm install packageName
    npm install parcel

- npm install -D parcel
D stands for dev dependencies, only used in development phase

- other dependecy is normal dependency that is done at production phase

Here we are doing many things that we dont want in our final end product so we are using -D for our code in development phase


## carat and tidle
 automatically upgrades the latest version or any update in package.json

- carat : ^ : upgrades only minor versions that are released if put in front of a version
ex: ^2.6.4 to 2.6.6
safe to use 
preferable



- tidle : - :upgrades major versions that are released if put in front of a version
not prefferable or safe
ex: -2.6.4 to 2.9.2


## package.lock.json
* keeps track of exact version
* locks the each minute,minor,approx verssion and keeps track of it
* no tidle or carat is used


## Node Modules
* All the code fetched from npm
* like a database ,collection of all the dependies of all the codes
* very heavy


### parcel : wow
### babel : wow ultimate

every dependency in parcel has its own package.json and package.lock.json


- Never put node modules on github , because very heavy codebase 
- always put the file in git ignoe file like
/node_modules
- if you have package.json and package.lock.json then you can recreate all the node modules
- only push essential file into the github like package.json or package.lock.json
- dont push anything that can be recreated like node modules
- every dependecies has its own package.json and package.lock.json

Igniting the app 
- npx parcel index.html

import React from "react"
second react represents react file in node modules

# Parcel 
- Do Build
- Local Server 
- HMR :Hot Module Replacement
