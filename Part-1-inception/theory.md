##### What is Emmet???
Emmet is a plugin or developer tool kit that helps make your work faster and substantially enhances HTML and CSS workflows.
pre-installed in VS Code and allows you to write your code quickly. If youâ€™re working in your VS Code editor for the first time and you want to begin writing code, you need to start with HTML, where the building blocks of code are formed.



#### crossorigin:
Cross-origin (or CORS{Cross-Origin Resource Sharing})
refers to a security feature that web browsers have. It's designed to protect your computer and data from potentially harmful code from different websites.
So, CORS in React is all about making sure your app can safely talk to other servers, like fetching data from an API, without compromising security. You need to configure the server (the other website) to allow your React app to communicate with it by setting the appropriate headers


- React can exist without redux,jsx or typescript too
